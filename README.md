These are my solutions to the programming-themed game "7 Billion Humans".           

Note: These are my own solutions. I'm not accepting PRs of others' solutions.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
You can import them into the game by selecting the code and then clicking the "Paste" button on the game's editor. Some of the solutions are set up with size and speed optimizations in separate programs.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The solutions cover all size and speed optimizations ("OCD"s) for all levels.

See there are 6 possible numbers, and the right hand area is 6 squares wide. The idea here is to have one worker blockade the area for each datacube number, and any worker approaching a blockaded space should jump down the hole. |                                                                                                                                                            
|44 - Unique Fashion Party (speed)              |44/11          |**57/75**      |  This used the size optimization program as a starting point. It special cased two things. First, the movement N squares to the right for workers holding data cube N. Second, earlying-out non-unique workers using the "divide by zero" trick. I think the "divide by zero" trick is kind of hacks, but the game accepts it so I guess it works. See the level requires that non-unique workers are killed but it **doesn't** care how. They don't necessarily have to do it by jumping in the holes. A quick way, it happens, is to divide 0/0 since it causes a worker to 'splode.|

And similarly to that one, there are some dummy calc instructions to make sure sensor workers run exactly in parallel. |

The idea here was to have **all** workers compute a running accumulator of the current power of two, and then use a poor man's bit shift to isolate the digit for their place value (e.g., ones, tens, hundreds). It's set up so all of these happen exactly in parallel with no synchronization between workers. It's worth pointing out that while you can only load a mem with literal values up to 99, mems can store values way higher than that- high enough so that there isn't some numerical limit holding back this approach. Anyway the calc instructions are, incidentally, what kills the speed. I still think the concept is cool. Since the button-operator is set up to idle around for exactly-the-right-amount-of-time, there is not much synchronization between workers at all.|

First, finding the most compact way to avoid hazardous holes, but permit the target hole. To do this I tried to exploit that multiple clauses if-ed together still count as one instruction. Second, the last one out needs to use the "tell" instruction. For this, I used a heuristic in the form of a many-clause if statement. The heuristic is just a heuristic, and won't be valid in 100% of cases. It makes the target so for now it's good enough. One thing that was good was to scope the "am I the last one out?" check down to happen in only a narrow set of circumstances.|

I used the size-optimization solution as a starting point, and started special-casing more things, fussing with it until it came under time. Very much an ugly and not a scientific process. |
